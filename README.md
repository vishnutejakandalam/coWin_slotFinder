# coWin_slotFinder  💉💉	

This python code can be used to find the vaccination slots at given dates and pincodes.

This uses the coWin API for getting data about vaccine slots.

## usage:
import requests module as

 pip install requests
```
run the file
```
python check.py
```


or (if you are having both python2 and python3)
```
python3 check.py

## `WARNING:`

CoWIN API is having trouble connecting to a server using VPN. I haven't tried many cases but it didn't work when I use one.

Its returning `403 forbidden error.`
